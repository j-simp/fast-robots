## Lab Tasks

For this lab, I decided to implememt the drift task. Below is the code that I used, which draws on previous labs:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/j-simp/12e0e6432999f09ad14d3f58dc43ce31.js"></script>

I first get the car to an appropiate distance from the wall, then the car does a 180 turn and drives in the direction it came from. I decided to only use P control because I knew that with an appropiate selection of the goal rotation angle the potential overshoot present would be negligable (and due to time constraints). At first, this led to a wide variation between trials:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 20px;">

</div>

But after tuning the target angle I was able to get better results:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 5px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <iframe width="350" height="200" src="https://youtube.com/embed/ccdulZH2w2I?feature=share" 
    frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  <iframe width="350" height="200" src="https://youtube.com/embed/zl4WBBpWMcA?feature=share" 
    frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  <iframe width="350" height="200" src="https://youtube.com/embed/S0pv9vBzzXg?feature=share" 
    frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

To get more of a drift effect, what I could do is keep the wheels spinning faster when the car is doing the 180.
