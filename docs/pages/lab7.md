title: "Kalman Filter"
description: '"The objective of Lab 7 is to implement a Kalman Filter, which will help you execute the behavior you did in Lab 5 faster. The goal now is to use the Kalman Filter to supplement your slowly sampled ToF values, such that you can speed towards the wall as fast as possible, then either stop 1ft from the wall or turn within 2ft."'
